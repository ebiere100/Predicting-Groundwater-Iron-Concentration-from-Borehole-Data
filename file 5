    "This study explores the application of machine learning models for predicting iron concentration in groundwater "
    "using spatial data derived from boreholes in Yenagoa, Nigeria. A dataset comprising 50 boreholes with geographic "
    "coordinates and iron concentration measurements was analyzed. Two regression models—Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) "
    "and Random Forest Regression (RFR)—were developed to predict iron concentration based on latitude, longitude, and town location. "
    "The linear regression model achieved superior performance with an R² of 0.92 on the test set, compared to 0.89 for the random forest model. "
    "Longitude and town location were the most influential predictors. Spatial visualization revealed an east-west gradient in iron levels, "
    "highlighting the utility of geographic features in environmental modeling."
